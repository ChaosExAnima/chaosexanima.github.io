# EchoNyc.blog

This is a [Astro](https://astro.build/)-powered personal blog for myself. It runs on GitHub Pages using their build process, and is entirely static HTML with a few bits of JS I wrote. You can read my blog [here](https://echonyc.blog).

Some features:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Thumbhash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/)-powered placeholder images
- Generates CSS gradient based on post title hash
