When you look,
What do you see?
Do you think I'm cute,
Or strange,
Or intimidating?
Should I consider myself
Fortunate
That you don't speak?
Am I a thing
To fear?
To possess?
To hurt?
To love?

I have seen you
In all countries
All bodies
Wearing so many faces
That you all seem the same

Eyes without words
Without meaning
Except those I hear
In my mind's eye
