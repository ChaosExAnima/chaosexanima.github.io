Hey there! I'm going to keep this short, as I've been dealing with a lot of things both in the world and my brain, so topics for a blog entry have been eluding me.

I guess you could say this is writer's block. Odd, really, it's often fairly simple to write about things in my life or thoughts in my head.

Regardless, I'm hopeful for July to calm down and for me to get back in the groove of things.

Some topics I do want to talk about: Wordless storytelling experiences and the power of music and dance. Gender role expectations and queer dating. Sex work. Dysphoria and beauty standards.

I suppose I do have things to talk about. I'll refer to that list going forward, and hopefully I can add more interesting topics as I think of them.
