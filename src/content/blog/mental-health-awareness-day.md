CW: Depression, self harm thoughts, institutionalization, trauma

I suffer from severe chronic depression. It's something I've had since early childhood, and I struggle with to this day and probably will till the day I die.

In childhood I had some really bad episodes, and have been institutionalized twice, the first time for at least a month when I was an adolescent (my memory is hazy). I've tried a list of drugs as long as your arm, and suffered some horrifying side effects. I'm traumatized as shit, and sometimes I am shocked I've managed to make it this far without hurting myself more.

The scary thing about depression is how _easy_ it can get. The more it happens the quicker your brain jumps to sad mode, or worse nothing at all. How a trigger can send you into a state of tears and despair with little rhyme or reason.

I've learned to express myself and channel my endless pit of loneliness and despair into ways that are healthier. I found ways to be cognizant of the people around me, even as part of me is in agony. It's taken a lot of hurt of myself and others along the way, and I regret that.

I'm saying all this not for the pity though. I'm not here to be a victim. I'm here to say that despite all this bullshit, despite all this pain, I live a fulfilled and happy life, or as happy as it can be.

To those of y'all out there suffering in silence, to those who can't get out of bed some days. I see you. I can't say that things are going to be fixed, but things can still be okay or even good.

And I think that makes it worth staying for.
